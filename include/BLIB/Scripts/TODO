upgrade grammar for reference types
upgrade grammar for parenthesis
upgrade grammar with something above Value to capture references, functions, etc. Probably just provide promotion from LValue to Value
In Script: Have base handleNode which can create callstack on error. Have function table from node type -> handler
In script parser: Flatten parse tree. Arg list, parameter list, and statement list are good places to flatten
Separate node parse from script so that other classes may evaluate nodes easily. Only need to pass Node and symbol table
Figure out how to propogate kill signal down script callstack while preserving thread safety (do it through symbol table!)
