upgrade grammar for reference types
Reference -> Amp Id. Special assignment to capture
In Script: Have base handleNode which can create callstack on error. Have function table from node type -> handler
In script parser: Flatten parse tree. Arg list, parameter list, and statement list are good places to flatten
Separate node parse from script so that other classes may evaluate nodes easily. Only need to pass Node and symbol table
In parser, need to consider current token as part of subsequence for reductionsPossible?
